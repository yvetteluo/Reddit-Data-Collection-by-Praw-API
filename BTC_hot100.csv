Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,77,11sswss,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/11sswss/bitcoin_newcomers_faq_please_read/,9,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)
* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](https://www.z-epub.com/book/1712)
* [Video 1: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONvg9SbauMg)
* [Video 2: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=286s) 
* [Video 3: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)
* [Video 4: But How Does Bitcoin Actually Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)

Some other great resources include Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [""Bitcoin for Everybody""'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course, Jameson Lopp's [resource page](http://lopp.net/bitcoin.html), Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical), and James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s).  Some excellent writing on Bitcoin's value proposition and future can be found at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/).  

If you are technically or academically inclined check out [developer resources](https://developer.bitcoin.org/) and peer-reviewed [research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg), course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/video-lectures/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) as well as future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  Some Bitcoin statistics can be found [here](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/), [here](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [here](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/) and [here](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/).  MicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.

You can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL) and [what you could have earned](https://dontbuybitcointheysaid.com/) if you didn't listen to them!  XD

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.earn.com/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](http://bitcoinsimplified.org/learn-more/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](http://i.imgur.com/wkTyyaV.png) better than gold or fiat
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://bitcoinfees.earn.com/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-technical-summary.pdf), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)
* [Gemini](https://gemini.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net/)
* [BitFinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/)
* [Xapo](https://xapo.com/)
* [Cex](https://cex.io/)
* [Bottlepay](https://bottlepay.com/)
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com/) (P2P)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). Services such as [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co/) let you purchase bitcoin with prepaid gift cards. If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin use [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://cryptowat.ch/bitstamp/btcusd) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn computer security best practices, then a hardware wallet such as the [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) or [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) is recommended.

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to let third party **""Bitcoin banks""** manage your coins, try [Gemini](https://gemini.com/) or [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware you may not be in control of your private keys in which case you would have to ask permission to access your funds and be exposed to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. This means that if you don't store your coins in a wallet that you control the keys to, then you do not really own your bitcoin as you have to ask permission from the third party in order to move them.  

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth | andOTP
--------------|--------|------------|--------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp)
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | N/A

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

Both Coinbase and Gemini support physical security keys. 


## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions you can [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/#global-bitcoin-nodes)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

He asked me if bitcoin would cause an even more drastic division of wealth than what exists today.

I don't think I gave a good enough answer and honestly it did kind of stump me.

He used Amazon as an example and said ""if Amazon keeps providing value, and they keep accumulating all the bitcoin with the earned revenue, wouldn't it cause a massive wealth division? Because people will be giving their bitcoin to amazon in exchange for goods. And Amazon jobs would be automated so Amazon has no one to pay bitcoin to.

Bitcoin is ridiculously undervalued!,46,121l0lk,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/121l0lk/bitcoin_is_ridiculously_undervalued/,28,"Gold has not been money for decades. It is not worth anywhere near as much as it would be were it to reassert itself as the monetary standard for all countries.

However gold will not reassert itself as money. At best it will act as a safe haven for people to hide from bank fragility and inflation. It is bitcoin that will end up asserting itself as global money as fiat collapses and all countries enter a global sovereign debt crisis.

Gold is worth $12 trillion currently and could double to $25 trillion if used as a safe haven. But if gold is nothing but a safe haven and bitcoin asserts itself as actual global money then bitcoin should be worth many multiples of gold. Conservatively lets say bitcoin should be worth double gold when gold is worth $25 trillion.

That puts bitcoin at a $50 trillion market cap just for it to reach fair value during a period of financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis. So lets say today before this financial crisis hits it should be no cheaper than 1/10th of its fair value of $50 trillion (ie $240k per btc).

So bitcoins fair value before a financial crisis should realistically be $240k per btc and in the midst of a financial crisis and global sovereign debt crisis it should be worth $2.4m per btc.

If we are entering a financial crisis and are at the beginning of a global sovereign debt crisis then bitcoin has to rise 85x just to reach fair value.

Afraid of Future US Regulatory Action?,10,121y2yr,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/121y2yr/afraid_of_future_us_regulatory_action/,14,"You always hear that it's almost impossible for the US or for any country to ban Bitcoin. While this may be true due to its decentralized nature, I have concerns about the US levying high taxes on Bitcoin capital gains in the future. What's to stop the US government from raising capital gains to 75% or 90%? When this type of regulatory question comes up on Twitter or different YouTube videos and debates, the answer is typically ""well, you can vote with your feet and move to a Bitcoin-friendly country"". But for US citizens it's not that easy because you owe US taxes anywhere in the world. Those capital gains will be paid no matter where you are. The next answer I see is ""well, you need to learn about CoinJoin or use Bisq"" but do we really expect the average Bitcoin holder to use p2p tech like Bisq if they wanted to sell a large amount of Bitcoin to purchase a home? At this point, you land on the ""well, by then you won't have to sell your Bitcoin because many businesses and companies will have BTC on their balance sheet and will be transacting in BTC"". That's a big if. I do think by 2030 BTC has the chance to hit between $500K-$1M, but I think it's unlikely that by then we'll be transitioning to a Bitcoin world. And I'm afraid sentiment is going to be very negative toward BTC holders - ""can you believe it? $500K a coin and those people did nothing to deserve it!"" - which leads to the US government levying high taxes on capital gains.

This honestly is keeping me from transitioning the majority of my stocks and assets to Bitcoin. I'm super bullish on BTC but I'm bearish on people in general and governments. I think the US government can make it very difficult for HNW BTC holders to use their earnings. I go back and forth that that would make a lot of powerful people angry and the government would backdown from such high capital gains, but I'm not sure.

3. 🇲🇽 Mexican Peso Crisis (1994-1995): A devaluation in the peso triggered this speculative attack as investors sold their peso-denominated assets. This loss of confidence forced Mexico to accept a U.S./IMF-led bailout and led to widespread contagion in other emerging markets.

4. 🇷🇺 Russian Financial Crisis (1998): Low oil prices and high debt-fueled a speculative attack on the ruble, causing it to plummet and leading to a severe recession and sharp increase in inflation.

5. 🇦🇷 Argentine Currency Crisis (2001-2002): An unsustainable fixed-to-the-dollar exchange rate system led to a speculative attack on the peso, resulting in a 70% devaluation and economic crisis.

Bitcoiners have long (since 2014!) speculated how Bitcoin will eventually be leveraged to perform a speculative attack, as we all know that good money drives out the bad money.

We recently summarized a classic Bitcoin piece that talks about what a speculative attack is and how Bitcoin can be used in such - in this 2-minute summary of Speculative Attack (2014) [www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/bitcoin-speculative-attack-on-the-dollar-2014](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/bitcoin-speculative-attack-on-the-dollar-2014)",1679761523.0

Bitcoin priced in the New Brics Global Reserve Currency,4,121quvd,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/121quvd/bitcoin_priced_in_the_new_brics_global_reserve/,13,"TradingView should get ready to show the BTC/BRICS chart once USD loses its world reserve currency status.

China & Russia buying tons of Gold as we speak because they going to say their new BRICS currency will be backed by Gold to get its adoption widely spread quickly.

If USD enter Hyperinflation where a loaf of bread cost $10,000 each for example then I doubt at that time people will sell their bitcoins for $1million each because what's the point of selling bitcoin so cheap at that point when your grocery shopping cart will prob cost you even more.

If china & russia say their currency is backed by gold then I think 1 Btc will be worth like 1000 Brics in the next bull market while in the hyperInflated usa 1 btc will be worth like $1gazillion in the next bull market lol. Just giving examples not saying these prices will be reached.

If they algorithmic ban bitcoin buying with their new $CBDC but BRICS CBDC allows bitcoin buying then the East and Russia will be the forefront in Crypto Bitcoin Industry.

Once the $dollar loses world reserve currency the USA will become a 3rd world country as well as Europe so I do not see crypto industry flourish there, it will flourish in the east and Russia.

Question to the US bitcoiners,10,121h6zy,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/121h6zy/question_to_the_us_bitcoiners/,59,"Hi people, as an non us citizen or resident I wonder how do you feel about your next vote. It seems to the outsiders that the latest choke 2.0 operation against Bitcoin and crypto in general is driven primarily by the democrats. The strongest polemics being by sen warren, the sec, the NY state in general, and Biden himself with the latest economic report release. This aggressive regulation without clear setting of the rules of the game (therefore not giving anyone the chance to play by the rules) coincides with the biggest bank crisis since 2008, perfectly timed to cut off leaks from tradfi to Bitcoin and crypto. It all poses the question ""if it is so worthless, why don't you let the free market decide. If it such a bad store of value why don't you let it compete on even playing field."" . My question is, do us citizens consider this a democrats problem? How many of you will vote for democrats in the next election? Do you believe republicans will do better?. Is a change in the leadership of the US going to be a solution or a problem? How many of you voted democrats and now will vote republican?  Why not organise a campaign ""I will no longer vote for Biden because of the unfair and authoritarian regulation of the crypto space"" Perhaps it will hit some strings if the movement is large .",1679738494.0

The URGENT need for easy P2P Bitcoin transactions in ARGENTINA,33,1215tzk,Bitcoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1215tzk/the_urgent_need_for_easy_p2p_bitcoin_transactions/,42,"Hi everyone!

I'll start of by saying that i'm not a Bitcoin expert in any way, shape or form. I'm just a worried citizen looking for help.

I live in ARGENTINA, a beautiful country with an inflation rate of about 100% per year. Our government insists that we use their currency, but it's becoming increasingly difficult to rely on it as a means of exchange. As a result, more and more people are turning to save their money in other coins as a way to protect their savings from inflation. We're on or way of becoming another Venezuela.

The problem is that it's not easy to buy Bitcoin in Argentina. There are few exchanges that allow us to purchase Bitcoin with our local currency, but very fewer that let us do it in a peer-to-peer manner. This makes it incredibly hard for us to access a valuable financial asset that could help us in being capable of saving money.

I need to emphasize that the situation in Argentina is very different from that in first-world countries. Here, the government pays close attention to every financial transaction that its citizens make, and we have a set amount of money that we can spend outside our country. As a result, using centralized exchanges to buy Bitcoin is not an option for many of us. We need a P2P solution that allows us to buy Bitcoin in a way that is safe, easy, and private, but most importantly: LOCAL.

The lack of easy and accessible P2P Bitcoin transactions is a significant barrier to achieving mass adoption in Argentina. Many people in our country are not tech-savvy, and even more are fearful of government control and taxes. Centralized exchanges can leave a trail of financial transactions that could be subject to government scrutiny and taxation. P2P transactions offer a way to buy and sell Bitcoin anonymously, which could help protect citizens from government surveillance and taxation. By creating a user-friendly platform for P2P Bitcoin transactions, we could help make cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone in Argentina, regardless of their level of technical expertise, and provide a way to protect their wealth from inflation. Or maybe it already exists and it's not well known. I've been searching and i didn't find any.

I believe that P2P Bitcoin transactions are crucial for the financial well-being of the people of Argentina. It's time for us to come together and create a platform that allows us to buy and sell Bitcoin in a way that works for us. We need a system that is relatively easy to use, secure, and anonymous. Only then can we truly protect our wealth and build a better future for ourselves and our families.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope that we can work together to make P2P Bitcoin transactions a reality in Argentina.",1679707066.0
